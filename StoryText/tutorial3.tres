(Boss): Cool beans! Now show him how steadily you can ready your chainsaw, chief. Use SPACEBAR to swing your chainsaw
(Boss): Wowee zowee! You’re a seasoned pro, bro! Now let him gaze upon your glorious A-B-C combo attack, legend! Time your chainsaw swings to do the Veteran-Up-Down-Stab Technique
(Boss): Well done! Now show him the strength of your stabilizer muscles. Hold SPACEBAR to perform a hold attack
(Boss): Nice, nice! We’re nearly there, pal! One last demonstration: show him how to do an upwards attack! Hold the UP key while swinging to aim overhead
(Boss): Perfect-o! That’s it! You’re done! I’m sure the new guy will be able to replace you just fine!
(You): Replace…?
(Boss): Nothing too shifty, chum! You’ve just trained our new number-one demon hunter! He promised that he would only work for a quarter of your pay, so we really wanted him on the team!
(You): Huh…?
(Boss): Yes, friend! You’ve been fired, hotshot! Now get out and go return to your previous occupation!
